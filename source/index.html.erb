      Computer science degrees are some of the most promising in terms of finding employment after graduation. These along with other STEM degrees offer the highest income and greatest flexibility. However, they are just not attracting the same (or even close) amount of woman and men.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a serious lack of women within the tech industry — especially the start up scene. Some women may be deterred from the “boys' club” this industry has become, others might not be aware that these types of jobs exist at all. The truth remains the same: we need more women in tech and and there is no one solution.

  <h3>Percent of Majors for Undergraduate Degrees</h3>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="m-two-five">
      <p>5% of college graduates are majoring in computer science or engineering, only 17% of these graduates are female. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, women tend to major in health professions, social services, education, and psychology while men tend to major in computer sciences, physical sciences, fitness studies, and agriculture.</p>
      <p>This is called <em>The Pipeline Problem</em> &mdash; this means that because there aren't many women studying engineering, there are just not women available to fill these positions.</p>
      <p>Why is this gap so massive?</p>

  <h2>Gender Bias</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="m-three">
      <p><strong>Issue #1:</strong>People actually believe that men have a genetic advantage in math and science related field.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="m-three">
      <p><strong>Issue #2:</strong> Because there are not many women in executive roles at tech companies, women are extremely underrepresented and some may not even realize these jobs are an option for them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="m-three">
      <p><strong>Issue #3:</strong> 44% of US women believe they have to act like a man to progress in the field.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="m-one">
      <p class="segway">The gender bias extends further than just women getting into the field, what about the women who make it through?</p>

        “I’ve been a programmer for 13 years, and I’ve always been one of the only women and queer people in the room. I’ve been harassed, I’ve had people make suggestive comments to me, I’ve had people basically dismiss my expertise. I’ve gotten rape and death threats just for speaking out about this stuff.”

  <h2>Women of Tech</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="m-two-five">
      <p>Tech companies employ an average of 12% women. The companies that have the most women, are the ones that are led by women.  Smaller teams tend to have a better male to female developer ratio, but as they grow, this percentage shrinks.</p>
      <p>These women who conquer the gender bias are also more likely to leave tech companies in only a year after starting.</p>

    <h2>Why are women quitting?</h2>
    <p>
      Start ups have many qualities that allow for sexist problems to go without mention. Founders and employees are generally friends, which causes a blurry line between work and social life. Most small tech companies don’t have HR departments where employees feeling attacked or alone could turn to.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be hard for women to voice their opinions and concerns to a company that is so heavily male dominated.

“But I don’t want to raise my hand and call negative attention toward myself, and become the woman who is the problem — ‘that woman.’ In start-up culture they protect their own tribe, so by putting my hand up, I’m saying I’m an ‘other,’ I shouldn’t be there, so for me that’s an economic threat.”
